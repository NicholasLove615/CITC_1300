                <h2>Brief History of Olympic Hockey</h2>
                <p>
                    Ice hockey first appeared at the Olympic Games in 1920 at the Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium.
                    It was moved to the Winter Olympics in 1924, where it became one of the core sports of the Games.
                    Since then, Olympic hockey has featured some of the fastest, most intense competition in all of sports.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For many years, Olympic hockey was dominated by amateur and national teams, with legendary rivalries 
                    between countries like Canada, the Soviet Union, the United States, Sweden, and Finland. The “Miracle on Ice” 
                    in 1980, when the underdog U.S. team defeated the heavily favored Soviet Union, is still one of the most 
                    famous moments in Olympic history.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 1998, the Olympics began allowing NHL players to participate, raising the overall skill level and turning 
                    the tournament into a true best-on-best showcase. Although NHL participation has changed over the years, 
                    Olympic hockey remains a huge stage where national pride and hockey tradition collide.

                <h3>Why Olympic Hockey Is Special</h3>
                <p>
                    Olympic hockey feels different from regular league play because players are representing their countries, 
                    not just their clubs. The atmosphere is intense, the games are short and meaningful, and every shift can 
                    change the entire tournament.
