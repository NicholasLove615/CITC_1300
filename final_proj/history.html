            <h2>Origins</h2>

        <p>Until the mid 1980s it was generally accepted that ice hockey derived from English field hockey and Indian lacrosse and was spread throughout Canada by British soldiers in the mid 1800s. Later, research then found a mention of a hockeylike game, played in the early 1800s in Nova Scotia by the Mi'kmaq Indians. The name hockey, as the organized game came to be known, has been attributed to the French word hoquet (shepard's stick). The term rink, referring to the designated area of play, was originally used in the game of curling in 18th century Scotland. Early hockey games allowed as many as 30 players a side on the ice, and the goals were two stones, each frozen into one end of the ice. The first use of a puck instead of a ball was recorded at Kingston Harbour, Ontario, Canada, in 1860.</p>

<h2>The National Hockey League</h2>
<p>In 1917 the NHA decided to disband and form a new league called the NHL. It became the world's foremost professional hockey league. In 1924 the first U.S. team, the Boston Bruins, joined the NHL. In 1925 the New York Americans and Pittsburgh Pirates were admitted, followed in 1926 by the New York Rangers, Chicago Blackhawks, and the Detroit Cougars. To stock the new teams, the NHL bought out the Patricks' league in 1926 for $250,000. Among the players who shifted to Boston was Eddie Shore, known as a rushing defenseman, whose style helped change the game. He was one of the sports most ferocious and skilled players, a forerunner of such future NHL players as Gordie Howe, who played mostly for the Detroit Red Wings. The Pittsburgh Pirates and the New York Americans eventually dropped out of the league. Until the expansion of 1967, the NHL was composed of only six teams: the Rangers, Bruins, Blackhawks, Red Wings, Toronto Maple Leafs, and the Montreal Canadiens. In 1967 the NHL undertook one of the greatest expansions in professional sports history when it doubled in size to 12 teams. A new 12-team league, the World Hockey Association, was formed in 1972, and the ensuing rivalry caused an escalation in players' salaries. In 1979 the NHL, which had grown to 17 teams, merged with the WHA to become a 21-team league. By 2017, 31 teams played in the NHL. In 2004, owners locked out players, insisting that they accept a salary cap that would slow the rapid growth of payroll costs. The players rejected the owners' demands, and the entire 2004-2005 season was canceled. The league resumed play in 2005-06 after the owners ultimately prevailed, and the NHL became the last of the major North American team sport leagues to institute a salary cap. The regular season now consists of 82 games and determines the 16 teams that will qualify for the playoffs. The playoff winner is awarded the Stanley Cup.</p>
