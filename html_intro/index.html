<h1>What is Yu-Gi-Oh</h1>

<p>Yu-Gi-Oh is a Japanese manga series that began in 1996 and follows Yugi, a boy who solves a puzzle, more specifically the ancient Millennium Puzzle. In doing so he awakens an alter-ego known as Dark Yugi. It originally started by featuring stories where the alter-ego would defeat villians in different games. Then later changed the focus to the card game Duel Monsters which most people now know as Yu-Gi-Oh TCG, and what I'll be exploring today.</p>
